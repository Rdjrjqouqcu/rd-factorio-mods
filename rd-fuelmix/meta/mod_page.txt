Mix fuels together to get standardized fuel.
Optionally, for more efficiency.

This mod is meant to simplify burnable fuel overflow systems by allowing all fuels to be processed to a single fuel mix.
For example, all of Pyanodon's burnable fluids can be converted into fuel mix, which has the same burn value.

### TODO
- Get better icons/add animations
- Disallow both fuel-mixes from being used in the fuel mixer
- High Throughput mixers that can output more than 1 unit per tick
- Fluid Fuel Mixer that has a built in overflow valve
