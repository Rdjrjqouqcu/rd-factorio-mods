## Rd's Compression

Dynamically creates compressed versions of configured items to faciliate extreme bulk storage.

This is based on Deep Storage Units, Deadlock's Stacking, Memory Storage, and similar storage mods.

#### Work in progress

Currently, there are plans to combine compression into a single composite entity that would work like a massive warehouse.
