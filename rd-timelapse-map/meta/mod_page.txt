Automatically takes screenshots regularly for use in a timelapse map.

Takes a screenshot of every chunk with an entity from certain forces every n minutes.
These screenshots can be used with leaflet or another map library to display a base or playthrough.



Each screenshot will be saved in script-output/timelapse-map/surface/x_y.png

A metadata.json file will also be created containing the following info:
```json
{
    "tick": 0,
    "minute": 0,
    "seed": 520997249,
    "tracked_surfaces": ["nauvis"],
    "tracked_forces": ["player"],
    "captured_chunks": {
        "nauvis": [[-2,0],[-1,-1],[-1,0],[0,-1],[0,0]]
    },
    "pixels_per_tile":64,
    "mods":{
        "base":"1.1.88",
        "rd-timelapse-map":"0.0.1",
        "creative-mod":"1.8.1"
    }
}
```


There is also a config option to replace "timelapse-map" with the world seed in all paths.



If you enable autosaving, will trigger a save when collecting chunk screenshots.

By default, it autosaves to saves/_autosave-timelapse-map/_autosave-timelapse-map/0000000.zip
  You will have to create these folders, otherwise it will pop up an error message and fail to save.
    See this bug report for more details: https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=105701
    There is also a feature request so that it doesn't have to be an autosave: https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=105700




Currently, this does not generate the website needed to display the chunk tiles.
I will eventually implement this, once I figure out the javascript.
