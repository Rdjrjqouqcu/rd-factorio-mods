## Rd's Timelapse Map Maker

Automatically takes screenshots regularly for use in a timelapse map.

Takes a screenshot of every chunk with an entity from certain forces every n minutes.
These screenshots can be used with leaflet or another map library to display a base or playthrough.

#### Outputs

Each screenshot will be saved in script-output/timelapse-map/surface/x_y.png

A metadata.json file will also be created containing the following info:
```json
{
    "tick": 0,
    "minute": 0,
    "seed": 520997249,
    "tracked_surfaces": ["nauvis"],
    "tracked_forces": ["player"],
    "captured_chunks": {
        "nauvis": [[-2,0],[-1,-1],[-1,0],[0,-1],[0,0]]
    },
    "pixels_per_tile":64,
    "mods":{
        "base":"1.1.88",
        "rd-timelapse-map":"1.0.0",
        "creative-mod":"1.8.1"
    },
    "map_exchange_string": ">>>...<<<"
}
```

There is also a config option to replace "timelapse-map" with the world seed in all paths.

#### Autosave

If you enable autosaving, will trigger a save when collecting chunk screenshots.

By default, it autosaves to saves/_autosave-timelapse-map/_autosave-timelapse-map/0000000.zip
- You will have to create these folders, otherwise it will pop up an error message and fail to save.
- See this bug report for more details: <https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=105701>
- There is also a feature request so that it doesn't have to be an autosave: <https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=105700>

#### Work in progress

Currently, this does not generate the website needed to display the chunk tiles.
I will eventually implement this, once I figure out the javascript.
